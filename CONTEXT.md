# PHARMACARE — QUICK CONTEXT
# Read this first in any new session

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT
PharmaCare is an Indian pharmacy management SaaS product.
Built for single-store pharmacies today, scaling to chains and hospitals tomorrow.
Target: All pharmacies across India.

## FOUNDER
Non-technical CEO/founder. Building with Claude Code + Claude.ai.
Needs plain English explanations. No jargon without explanation.

## CURRENT BRANCH
`main` — listing pages and backend work
`claude/compassionate-agnesi` — design consistency fixes (active)

## TECH STACK
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI (JavaScript, converting to TypeScript)
- Backend: Python FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 async + PostgreSQL
- ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.0 async
- Auth: JWT

## ACTIVE BACKEND (PostgreSQL — port 8000)
The PostgreSQL routers (`backend/routers/*` + `backend/main.py`) are the active backend.
Start with: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
Frontend `.env.local` → `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000`

## LEGACY BACKUP (MongoDB — DO NOT START)
`backend/server.py` is the original MongoDB backend — kept as rollback reference only.
It has a prominent warning comment at the top. Do not run it. Do not delete it.
If needed for rollback: `uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload`

## WHAT WE ARE DOING
Full refactor to international engineering standard:
1. ✅ PostgreSQL schema (21 tables) — DONE
2. ✅ Split server.py into 14 router files — DONE
3. ✅ Migrate MongoDB queries → PostgreSQL in each router — 15/15 COMPLETE
4. ✅ Frontend constants + utils + hooks — DONE
5. ✅ TypeScript conversion — DONE
6. ✅ Break down giant files — DONE (9 files → 73 focused files, all ≤300 lines)
7. ✅ Fix broken pages — DONE
8. ✅ Add missing features (pagination, barcode, print) — DONE
9. 🔄 Design consistency fixes — IN PROGRESS ← CURRENT

## CRITICAL RULES
- One task at a time. Review before next task.
- No file over 300 lines
- Never delete server.py (kept as backup)
- Always commit after each completed task
- Money = INTEGER paise (₹1 = 100 paise). Never floats.
- Steel Blue #4682B4 is the ONLY primary color. Never teal.
- PHARMACARE_DESIGN_SKILL.md is the single design reference. Read it before any frontend work.
- Soft deletes only — never hard delete pharmacy data
- Snapshot product details in bills — never reference live product name
- Shadcn/UI exclusively — no other component libraries

## WHAT IS WORKING NOW
All features are complete and functional. The app works end to end.
Currently polishing: design consistency across all pages.

- ✅ All billing, purchases, inventory, returns, suppliers, customers features
- ✅ Dashboard, reports, GST report, compliance, audit log, stock movement log
- ✅ Consistent PageHeader on Dashboard, Reports, Suppliers pages
- ✅ BillingWorkspace — labeled-column subbar, action buttons in header
- ✅ PurchaseNew — labeled-column subbar, action buttons in header
- 🔄 Rounds 1–4 design violation fixes (banned colors, badges, modals, row hover) — PENDING

## NEXT TASK
Design Consistency — Round 1: banned colors + raw axios (see PROGRESS.md)

## DESIGN COMMITS (April 18, 2026)
- `f2052b8` — Billing & Purchase workspace redesign (labeled subbars, header CTAs)
- prev session — PageHeader consistency (Dashboard, Reports, Suppliers)

## PHASE 6 COMMITS (ALL COMPLETE)

2. `5ae85cf` — InventorySearch (1,591 → 11 files)
3. `a387a9e` — PurchaseNew (1,231 → 9 files)
4. `bc36c17` — MedicineDetail (1,108 → 8 files)
5. `aeefb9b` — Customers (771 → 7 files)
6. `9646f24` — Suppliers (747 → 6 files)
