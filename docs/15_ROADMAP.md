## MANIFESTO ITEMS NOT YET BUILT

These are confirmed requirements from CLAUDE.md `WHAT'S NEXT`. Build in this order:

### 1. Sheets (right-side drawers) — `📋 Planned`

Replace all centered modals for data-entry forms.

- **What:** Shadcn `<Sheet side="right">`, 480px wide
- **Where:** New bill form, new purchase form, add/edit medicine, add supplier
- **Why:** Industry standard (Linear, Notion) — better for complex forms than centered modals
- **Rule:** All new data-entry forms must use Sheet. No new centered modals.

### 2. Zod + react-hook-form on all forms — `📋 Planned`

- **What:** Every form uses `zodResolver` with a schema
- **Where:** All forms in Billing, Purchases, Inventory, Settings
- **Why:** Consistent validation, type-safe, eliminates uncontrolled inputs
- **Rule:** No new form without a Zod schema

### 3. Error retry states — `📋 Planned`

- **What:** Network errors show Shadcn `<Alert variant="destructive">` + Retry button
- **Where:** Every page that fetches data
- **Why:** No silent failures
- **Rule:** Every `catch` block must display something. See `12_ERROR_HANDLING.md`.

### 4. Command Palette — `📋 Planned`

- **What:** `Cmd+K` opens global search
- **Searches:** Bills (by number/customer), medicines, customers, suppliers
- **UI:** Shadcn `<Command>` component
- **Rule:** Does not block any current work. Build after Sheets + Zod.

### 5. Speed keys — `📋 Planned`

- `n` = new (context-aware — new bill on billing page, new product on inventory)
- `f` = open filter panel
- `/` = focus search
- `Esc` = close sheet/modal
- `Enter` = confirm primary action

## PHASE 2 — MULTI-STORE CHAINS `🚫 Do not build now`

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Chain / HQ account | One account, multiple store locations |
| Store switcher in sidebar | |
| Cross-store stock transfer | |
| Centralized purchase orders | HQ orders for all stores |
| Chain-level GST reports | |
| Store-level P&L | |

> **Do not add `chain_id`, `store_id`, or any multi-store column to Phase 1 tables.** It creates premature complexity. Phase 2 will be a migration sprint.

---

## PHASE 3 — PLATFORM `🚫 Do not build now`

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Patient app (prescription refills) | |
| Doctor portal (e-prescriptions) | |
| Distributor integration (live price lists) | |
| Government reporting API (CDSCO) | |
| WhatsApp / SMS reminders (refills, dues) | |
| Accounting integration (Tally, Zoho Books) | |

---

## WHAT NOT TO BUILD (ever, in Phase 1)

| Request | Why not |
|---------|---------|
| IGST support | All sales are intra-state in Phase 1 |
| Multi-currency | Indian market only |
| Online pharmacy (sell to patients online) | Regulatory complexity, out of scope |
| Controlled substance (Schedule X) billing | Requires different compliance system |
| Insurance claims / CGHS | Phase 3+ |
| AI drug interaction checker | Not a pharmacy management feature |
| Hard delete anything | Compliance — forever forbidden |

---

| Bill PDF template incomplete | Medium | Renderer exists, layout WIP |
| Low stock / expiry alerts not surfaced in UI | Medium | Backend flags exist |
| Bulk upload UX incomplete | Medium | Backend done |
| Margin report UI WIP | Low | Data available via API |
